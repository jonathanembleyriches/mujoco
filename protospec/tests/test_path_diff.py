"""Compile-path differential gate for the ProtoSpec bridge (ps_path_diff).

This test proves the *harness* that will judge the upcoming mjSpec compile path,
built and exercised NOW against the shipping XML path so that when
``CompilePath::MjsPath`` lands it is a one-flag flip:

    ps_path_diff --path-a XmlPath --path-b MjsPath <corpus>

Today the tool runs two gates over the checked-in fixture corpus
(``fixtures/pathdiff/``):

* **identity** -- ``XmlPath`` vs ``XmlPath``: the same deterministic compile path
  twice must yield a bit-identical ``mjModel`` (every MJMODEL_SIZES int, every
  name table in id order, every MJMODEL_POINTERS array, and the qpos0 forward-
  kinematics invariants). Any divergence is a determinism bug in the harness.
* **against-stock** -- ProtoSpec's ``XmlPath`` result vs stock ``mj_loadXML`` of
  the *original* file. This catches ProtoSpec reader/writer drift (the round trip
  changing the model), which a path-vs-path diff cannot see because both legs
  share the same front end. Auto-naming is disabled on this leg so the compare is
  against stock's pristine name tables.

Build strategy
--------------
The tool is a MuJoCo-linked C++ program. Rather than drive the CMake tree (which
targets the author's Windows MuJoCo), a session fixture compiles it directly with
``g++``: the three harness ``.cc`` files (ps_path_diff + model_diff_lib +
plugin_registry) against the ProtoSpec include dirs, linking the prebuilt
``libprotospec_core.a`` + ``libmujoco.so`` from a prebuilt ``build_ps`` tree.

    Speed vs. staleness: linking the prebuilt ``libprotospec_core.a`` is far
    faster than recompiling every ProtoSpec ``.cc`` from source, but the archive
    is a *snapshot*. If the compile bridge / reader / writer sources change
    without rebuilding ``build_ps``, this test links stale object code. Rebuild
    it (or point ``PROTOSPEC_BUILD_PS_LIB`` at a fresh build) after touching
    ``protospec/lib`` compile/io sources.

The lib dir defaults to ``build_ps/lib`` at the enclosing checkout root; the
MuJoCo include dir defaults to the enclosing checkout's ``include/``. Both are
overridable:

    PROTOSPEC_BUILD_PS_LIB   dir holding libprotospec_core.a + libmujoco.so
    PROTOSPEC_MJ_INCLUDE     dir holding mujoco/mujoco.h + mujoco/mjxmacro.h

The whole module skips cleanly when those are absent (e.g. CI without a prebuilt
tree), so a plain ``uv run pytest`` stays green everywhere.
