// ProtoSpec compile boundary: Model -> mjModel + Binding (plan DR-5/DR-10/DR-11,
// milestone 5). This is the production contract the native compiler lands behind
// later (native-compiler impl-plan Section 1). Two shipping implementations
// exist:
//   * XmlPath: WriteMjcf(model) -> register assets + the XML in an mjVFS ->
//     mj_loadXML -> name-based Binding. The oracle, still reachable when forced.
//   * MjsPath: build a throwaway mjSpec from the tree -> mj_compile -> the same
//     name-based Binding (bit-identical to XmlPath on every mjs-reproducible
//     model, per the ps_path_diff parity gate). The mjs builder reproduces nearly
//     every family (macros, builtin meshes, URDF/MJB children, plugins,
//     deformables, exotic sensors/textures) with full parity.
// Auto prefers MjsPath. The mjSpec fallback scan (MjsFallbackScan) returns two
// kinds of guard, and Auto treats them differently:
//   * always-error (e.g. coordinate="global"): invalid on every path, so Auto
//     surfaces a clean model error directly rather than routing to XmlPath to
//     fail there.
//   * fallbackable (flexcomp <pin>, type=direct, material auto-texcoord): a valid
//     model the mjs_makeFlex/mjSpec API cannot reproduce. Auto ROUTES it to
//     XmlPath (recording the reasons in report.fallback_reasons; report.taken ==
//     XmlPath). Forced MjsPath never falls back -- it errors loudly.
// report.taken always names the path that actually ran; report.fallback_reasons
// records why MjsPath was declined even when Auto succeeded on XmlPath.
// NativePath remains parked in attic and is reached only when explicitly forced
// (PROTOSPEC_NATIVE); Auto never routes to it.
//
// Purity (CDR-14): Compile / Recompile take const Model& end to end and never
// mutate the tree (no const_cast). Unnamed elements are auto-named only in the
// emitted compile-XML, via a serial-keyed override map -- the tree is untouched.
//
// Concurrency: concurrent Compile calls on the same const Model& are
// memory-safe (per-call state is stack-owned or thread-local). Warning capture
// borrows the process-global mju_user_warning hook only for the mj_loadXML /
// mj_compile window, under a process-global mutex that SERIALIZES ProtoSpec
// compiles: two ProtoSpec borrow windows never overlap, so the host's handler is
// always saved and restored cleanly. The handler is host-owned -- a host compile
// running concurrently with a ProtoSpec compile will briefly see our handler for
// the borrow window (an accepted, documented limitation; see public_api.md). Hook
// callbacks route to a thread-local sink, so captured warnings are only ever
// attributed to the borrowing thread and land in that compile's report. MuJoCo
// plugin registration must complete before concurrent compiles (the engine's own
// process-global rule).
//
// This header forward-declares mjModel/mjData and never includes mujoco.h.
